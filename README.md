Satellite Hydrology Bits Analysis And Mapping (SHBAAM) is a Python and bash 
shell toolbox that combines many repetitive pre and post-processing tasks that 
are common to studying the studying the terrestrial water cycle with satellite 
data. 

Such tasks include the preparation of files corresponding to:

- Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly using GRACE data

## Installation on Windows 10
This document was written and tested on a machine with a **clean** image of
Windows 10, 64-bit, installed. The following instructions were prepared for
Windows **PowerShell** which shall be run in **administrator mode**.

Note that the experienced users may find more up-to-date installation
instructions in
[.appveyor.yml](https://github.com/c-h-david/shbaam/blob/master/.appveyor.yml).

### Download SHBAAM
First, make sure that `choco` is installed:

```
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Second, make sure that `git` is installed:

```
PS C:\> choco install git
```

Then download SHBAAM:

```
PS C:\> git clone https://github.com/c-h-david/shbaam
```

Finally, enter the SHBAAM directory:

```
PS C:\> cd shbaam\
```

### Install Chocolatey packages
Software packages for Chocolatey are summarized in
[requirements.cho](https://github.com/c-h-david/shbaam/blob/master/requirements.cho)
and can be installed with `choco`. All packages can be installed at once using:

```
PS C:\> choco install --no-progress ((gc requirements.cho) -notmatch '^#' -match '\S')
```

> Alternatively, one may install the Chocolatey packages listed in
> [requirements.cho](https://github.com/c-h-david/shbaam/blob/master/requirements.cho)
> one by one, for example:
>
> ```
> PS C:\> choco install miniconda
> ```
>
> Note that by default, `wget` in is aliased to the PowerShell
> `Invoke-WebRequest`, and one may to remove this alias before installing
> `wget`:
>
> ```
> PS C:\> rm Alias:wget
> ```

The Chocolatey installation of `conda`  does not update the environment
variables, so the following action must be taken:

```
PS C:\> $ENV:PATH="C:\\ProgramData\\MiniConda2;C:\\ProgramData\\MiniConda2\\Scripts;$ENV:PATH"
```

The Chocolatey installation of `git`  does not update the environment
variables to give access to `bash` and `sh`, so the following action must be
taken:

```
C:\> $ENV:PATH="C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin;$ENV:PATH"
```

### Install Anaconda packages
Python packages from the Anaconda Package Repository are summarized in
[requirements.cnd](https://github.com/c-h-david/shbaam/blob/master/requirements.cnd)
and can be installed with `conda`. All packages can be installed at once using:

```
PS C:\> conda install -y -q -c anaconda --file requirements.cnd
```

> Alternatively, one may install the Anaconda packages listed in
> [requirements.cnd](https://github.com/c-h-david/shbaam/blob/master/requirements.cnd)
> one by one, for example:
>
> ```
> PS C:\> conda install -y -q -c anaconda numpy
> ```

## Testing on Windows 10
Testing scripts are currently under development.
